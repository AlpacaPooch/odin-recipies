        <h1>Air Fried Bacon Wrapped Shrimp</h1>
        <img src="../images/air-fried-bacon-wrapped-shrimp.webp">
        <p>Simple to put together with only 4 ingredients, but big on flavor! I like to use "extra jumbo" size shrimp, which are 16-20 per pound. Cutting the bacon lengthwise into narrow strips makes it easier to wrap. Refrigerating the shrimp, as well as using thin-cut bacon, will prevent the shrimp from overcooking in the time it takes to crisp the bacon.</p>
        <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>16 jumbo shrimp</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp cajun seasoning</li>
            <li>8 strips thin sliced bacon, cut in half</li>
            <li>16 toothpicks</li>
            <li>2 tbsp hot honey</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>Directions</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place shrimp on a plate and sprinkle both sides with Cajun seasoning. Wrap each shrimp with 1 narrow strip of bacon and fasten with a toothpick. Refrigerate for 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Air-fry shrimp for 3 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until bacon is lightly crispy, 4 to 5 minutes more. You may have to do 2 batches depending on the size of your air fryer.</li>
            <li>Remove shrimp to a plate and drizzle with hot honey. Serve immediately, being watchful of any toothpicks.</li>
        </ol>
